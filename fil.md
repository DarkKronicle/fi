# Fuzzy Interpretation of Likelihood \(F.I.L.\)

A way to clarify ambiguous words that deal with probability.

## The Table of FIL

* `x` refers to the current measurement/modifier.
* All of these times are uncertain to a degree of +-5%.
* If relationship is a number that is the percentage / 100 of the likelihood.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Yes | Y | 1 | \* |
| No | N | 0 | \* |
| Maybe | M | 0.5 | \* |
| Potentially | Po | 0.15 | \* |
| Definitely | D | 0.99 | \* |
| Probably | Pr | 0.85 | \* |
| Perhaps | Pe | 0.3 | \* |

### Modifiers

| Modifier | Relationship | Operator |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
