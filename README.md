# Fuzzy Interpretation of Time (F.I.T.)

A way to interperate time in a way that is not rigid, unlike set amount of times.

## What is FIT

Fit is a standardized system of relative fuzzy time measurements that is designed to fit into everyday conversation. 

Within casual relationships, it's common to ask for availability ("When are you available to do *x*"), and it's just as common to get a vague answer (*"In a bit...", "Soon-ish?"*). FIT aims to clear up this confusion, by allowing for a concrete measurement of these casual measurements

## The Table of FIT

| Measurement | Relationship |
|-------------|----------|
| Long        | Long |
| Later       | <= 1.5 Long |
| Soon        | 0.25 Long |
| Eventually  | 0 < x < ∞ Long |
| Right Now   | 0.000000000000001 |

| Modifier    | Relationship |
|-------------|---------|
| No(t)       | ∞ |
| en          | Float < 1 |
| Ish         | Float between: 0 < x <= 1.5 |
| Maybe       | 1 or ∞ Boolean |
