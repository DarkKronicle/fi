# Fuzzy Interpretation of Time (F.I.T.)

A way to interperate time in a way that is not rigid, unlike set amount of times.

## What is FIT

With casual relationships, you typically ask them when they can do something, and they typically reply with a set in stone answer. FIT aims to remove these problems by having all time interpretation be fuzzy and not set.

## The Table of FIT

| Measurement | Relationship |
|-------------|----------|
| Long        | Long |
| Later       | <= 1.5 Long |
| Soon        | 0.25 Long |
| Eventually  | 0 < x < ∞ Long |
| Right Now   | 0.000000000000001 |

| Modifier    | Relationship |
|-------------|---------|
| No(t)       | ∞ |
| en          | Float < 1 |
| Ish         | Float between: 0 < x <= 1.5 |
| Maybe       | 1 or ∞ Boolean |
